## üì• Download Trained Weights

To use the trained model weights:

- Download from Google Drive: [`best.pt`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAHfkK7xEC6IV7AkII90PFNUF82m7oot/view?usp=sharing)

- Or run inference directly:

```bash
python get_weights.py --model player --video input_videos/video_1.mp4    # Run inference using the PLAYER detection model on a specific video.
python get_weights.py --model ball --conf 0.3                            # Run inference using the BALL detection model with a lower confidence threshold (0.3).
python get_weights.py --model keypoint --video input_videos/video_2.mp4  # Run inference using the COURT KEYPOINT model to detect keypoints (e.g. lines, markers) on a basketball court.
